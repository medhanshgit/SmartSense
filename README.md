## Overview

1. Problem Statement:
- Train a model to predict the price of a used car based on its specifications.

2. Data:

- The dataset contains information about used cars.

3. Evaluation:

- Code.ipynb contains the EDA as well as the prediction for the problem statement.

- Used Linear Regression as well as random Forrest regressor for completing the task.

## <b>Approach</b>:

## Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a simple and interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It's a good starting point for understanding how a change in each independent variable affects the target variable. Here's the rationale for using Linear Regression in this context:

Interpretability: Linear regression provides clear interpretations of the effect of each feature (like 'Year' and 'Mileage') on the target variable ('Price'). The coefficients in a linear regression equation indicate how much the target variable changes for a one-unit change in each feature.

Simplicity and Speed: Linear regression is computationally efficient and quick to train, making it suitable for large datasets. It's also a simple model that requires minimal tuning.

Baseline Model: Linear regression can serve as a baseline model, providing a benchmark against which more complex models like Random Forest can be compared.

## Random Forest:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple individual decision trees to make a final prediction. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features. Here's the rationale for using Random Forest in this context:

Nonlinearity and Complex Relationships: Random Forest can capture nonlinear and complex relationships between features and the target variable. It's capable of fitting a wide range of data patterns.

Feature Importance: Random Forest provides feature importances, allowing us to understand which features (like 'Year' and 'Mileage') are most influential in predicting 'Price'. This can aid in feature selection and understanding the data better.
